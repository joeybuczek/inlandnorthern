          Model Railroad Layout for the Inland Northern Railroad
        </h3>
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p class="text-justify">
          The layout is currently a work in progress from a conceptual
          standpoint, however the main idea is that it represents a small
          portion of the Inland Northern Railroad&#146;s freight operations in
          central Illinois centered around a single ethanol and bio-feed
          industry. The layout is intended to support up to four operators, with
          two dedicated to the switching operations of the main industry, one
          for local service, and one for other tasks as needed. Work lists for
          the operators are provided via custom software written specifically
          for use with this layout.

          <h3>Logo</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">
            The Inland Northern&#146;s logo is a stylized representation of the
            first letter from each of the first two words in the company name,
            with the lower inside of the "N" as a solid amber color to represent
            the agricultural nature of the company&#146;s operations. It was
            inspired by the verse "For amber waves of grain" from the 1893 poem
            "America the Beautiful" written by Katharine Lee Bates.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            When on a light background, the logo is black and amber. When on a
            dark background, the logo is white and amber.

            Most of the motive power owned by the Inland Northern are a dark
